<!--
Copy the questions below into the first-lastname.txt file on your github repo - answer each question and then push your changes. 

    1. What is Semantic HTML? 
    Semantic HTML uses tags that contain meaning, e.g. "strong" or "h1" that describe the way information should be presented.
    The alternative, "presentational HTML" uses generic tags like "div" which only tell us "this is a container"

    2. What is HTML used for? 
    To create a standard way to describe the content of a web page, allowing a user's browser to render it.

    3. What is an attribute and where do we put it? 
    An attribute goes inside an opening HTML tag and is uses to provide additional essential information. 
    The most common is probably href inside the <a> or anchor tag, which says, "this is the spot we're linking to"
    src inside an image tag tells us where to get the image from. They can provide information about 
    size, color, etc. and essentially act as modifiers to the tag


    4. What is the h1 tag used for? How many times should I use it on a page?
    For the most important header on the page. It should be used once, both for meaning and for 
    search engine optimization.

    5. Name two tags that have required attributes
    <a>, <img>

    6. What do we put in the head of our HTML document? 
    We place data about the page, called metadata. It can include tiles, fonts, styles, scripts.
    
    7. What is an id? 
    An ID is an identifier for a specific piece of HTML. It allows us to style it by referring to its
    name. It can also be called out programmaticaly using JavaScript, e.g.

    8. What elements can I add an id to? 
    In HTML 5, all of them.

    9. How many times can I use the same id on a page? 
    Correctly, only once. If an ID is reused however, it will often produce an acceptable result as 
    multiple elements reusing the same ID will lead typically to the first one being acted on.

    10. What is a class? 
    A class is an HTML selector method that allows similar items to be styles or worked on programmatically
    as if they are put of one group. So for example everything in a class called .headline could be
    styled to use the same font, font size, emphasis, color, et al.

    11. What elements can I add a class to? 
     All of them.

    12. How many times can I use the same class on a page? 
    As many times as it makes sense.

    13. How do I get my link to open in a new tab?
    add target="_blank" to the opening anchor tag

    14. What is the alt attribute in the image tag used for? 
    It is used by screen readers to help explain to, e.g. the sight impaired what the image contains
    It also serves the similar purpose of explaining what image should be there in case it is missing

    15. How do I reference an id?
    in the HTML tag creating the id, it's id="idname"
    in the CSS, calling out the ID it's #idname
    
    
    16. What is the difference between a section and a div
    A div is a generic HTML container. If we need to style a portion of the page but that portion
    otherwise isn't a logic element, our "quick hack" is to wrap it in a div and style that div.

    A section is ostensibly a semantically meaningful container like a chapter, a header, a footer. 
    Effectively they can be used similarly though in modern HTML the section is preferable when 
    possible. 

    17. What is CSS used for? 
    To style all the elements of a web page

    18. How to we select an element? Example - every h2 on the page
      we just call out the tag and then put the necessary style commands inside {}

    h2 {
        style stuff goes here
    }

    19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one
    Classes are probably used to call out all the same elements of a type, whether a specific tag or not
    For example, if we want all the material we wrote originally to be in dark green helvetica we might
    create a class called .ourStuff and put CSS commands in it to make it all look similar

    Because an ID is properly only used once, we might have say some specific header we want to put in
    Comic Sans because we are evil and so we'd call out #makeThisUgly in the CSS and style it accordingly


    20. How do we select classes in CSS?
    With .classname

    21. How do we select a p element with a single class of “human””?
    .human p {

    }
    This basically uses the descendent selector p (a space) to grab all the paragraphs
    in class human

    22. What is a parent child selector? When would this be useful? 
    It allows us to grab all the elements that are "children" of a given part of the page.
    So for example if we created a div so that we could style it specically (a common use of divs)
    we would then be able to select all the paragraphs (p) and style them accordingly


    23. How do you select all links within a div with the class of sidebar?
    .sidebar a {

    }
    
    24. What is a pseudo selector?
    One that selects based on state, for example whether a link has been visited or whether the
    user is hovering over a page element. THey are created with a colon as in "a:hover" "a:visited"
    When used programmatically, they can powerful for manipulated children, parents, etc. in the DOM
    
    25. What do we use the change the spacing between lines?
    line-height will allow you to manipulate spacing between lines

    26. What do we use to change the spacing between letters?
    letter-spacing will do this

    27. What do we use to to change everything to CAPITALS? lowercase? Capitalize?
    uppercase, lowercase, capitalize

    28. How do I add a 1px border around my div that is dotted and black?
    border: 1px dotted black;

    29. How do I select everything on the page? 
    Using the universal selector *

    30. How do I write a comment in CSS?
    wrap them inside /* the comment block magic of this */

    31. How do I find out what file I am in, when I am using the command line?
    The directory you are in can be seen from the command prompt itself
    Being "in a file" doesn't really make sense to me here.

    32. Using the command line - how do I see a list of files/folders in my current folder?
    Use the ls command

    33. How do I remove a file via the command line? Why do I have to be careful with this? 
    Using the rm command
    The danger of this is there is no confirmation and no undelete
    
    
    34. Why should I use version control? 
    To keep track of how code changes over time. It allows you to go back and find the code that 
    was good before some changes might have added a bug or merely to revert to a last know high 
    quality state

    35. How often should I commit to github?
    Whenever a substantive change is made. Especially if you know the change is working. Frequently otherwise.

    36. What is the command we would use to push our repo up to github? 
    git push -u origin 'nameofourbranch'


    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow. 
        1) Fork
        2) add collaborator(s) as needed, always the TL
        3) on your local machine, make a clone via 
            git clone <whatever-the-url-is>
            we now have a copy of our fork ready to work on locally
        4) now we branch our local copy 
            go to the directory we have the clone
            git checkout -b 'firstname-lastname'
        5) once we make our changes, we have to push 
            git push -u origin firstname-lastname

            Then once it's pushed we tell github to make all pushes to our brand
        6) finally we add our collaborators to review the pull

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    Inline elements don't start a new line, block elements both start a new line and take all available width

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    It is positioned relative to the nearest ancestor (if such a thing exist) or else it will just take its place in the document body


    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    first we need to use display: flex 
    then we can use max-width to cap it at a certain size and min-width to ensure it doesn't get squeezed out of existence if neeeded


    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    <h1, 2, 3, etc.>, <nav>, <ol> are block 
    <span>, <img> are inline
    <button> is inline-block by default

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
    The box model says every element has a box around with margins, borders, padding and content. We can figure out the elements size by adding it borders
    and padding to the width we give it for example.

    To avoid unexpected results, especially when designing responsive sites, we can use box-sizing: border-box which takes the borders and padding
    from the width we have allotted. There is still the issue of margins, but at least the thing itself is constrained this way.
